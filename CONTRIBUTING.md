# Contributing to AeonFlux Labs
Thank you for your interest!

Quick summary:
- Fork & branch
- Small, focused PRs
- Include manifest.yaml when adding significant content
- Governance-sensitive changes → open MetaLogical query first
- Use Post-Quantum Security (PQS) signing for commits (see .github/workflows/pqs-setup.yml)
